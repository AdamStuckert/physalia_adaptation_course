# Exploring the haploblock on Chr 4

## Prepare data for this tutorial

Thanks to our local PCA exploration on day 2, we know that there are non-recombining haploblocks which may be an inversion on chromosome 4.
We located the breakpoints approximately from 4.8MB to 16.6MB



## Back to the PCA: genotype the individuals

## Studying linkage disequilibrium

## Studying divergence (Fst, dxy)

## Studying heterozygosity
