# physalia_adaptation_course

This repository includes scripts and data associated with the practical sessions of the Physalia Course about Adaptation Genomics
Prepared by Anna Tigano, Yann Dorant and Claire MÃ©rot

## Day1: Handling NGS data: From raw reads to SNPs matrix

Capelin data: They are taken from Cayuela et al,2020. Molecular Ecology https://doi-org.acces.bibl.ulaval.ca/10.1111/mec.15499
 
Genome assembly: For this course, we made a dummy assembly of about 90 MB (instead of about 500 MB) and 5 chromosomes (instead of 24).

Raw reads: Obtained by GBS methods, sequenced with IonTorrent.
 
## Day2: Population structure and confounding factors

## Day3: Outlier detection - Environmental associations

## Day4: Accounting for Structural Variants

## Day5: Functional approaches
